# Xcode Cloud post-clone hook.
#
# Apple runs this once per workflow execution, immediately after the repo is
# checked out and before Xcode resolves dependencies. Xcode Cloud looks for the
# ci_scripts folder NEXT TO the .xcodeproj — and this project is generated in the
# "EB Finder/" subdirectory — so this script must live at
# "EB Finder/ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh", NOT the repo root (a repo-root
# ci_scripts is silently ignored when the project lives in a subdirectory, which
# is why the first tag build failed at "Resolve package dependencies"). All paths
# below resolve from $CI_PRIMARY_REPOSITORY_PATH (the repo root), so the script's
# logic is unaffected by where ci_scripts sits.
#
# What we do here:
#   1. Install a pinned XcodeGen and generate "EB Finder.xcodeproj" from
#      project.yml — the project file is generated, never committed.
#   2. Stamp MARKETING_VERSION with the UTC build date (YYYY.M.D). Versions are
#      calendar-based and fully automatic — no tags or bumps. (The extension's
#      manifest.json derives its version from MARKETING_VERSION via a build phase
#      in project.yml, so it's stamped automatically too, local builds included.)
#   3. Stamp CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION (CFBundleVersion) with Xcode Cloud's own
#      unique build number ($CI_BUILD_NUMBER).
#
# Version keys live in EB Finder/Config/Version.xcconfig and are read at build
# time. Nothing secret is committed: signing identity is NOT in the repo —
# DEVELOPMENT_TEAM lives only in the git-ignored Config/Signing.local.xcconfig
# (composed via `#include?` from Config/Build.xcconfig). For Archive actions
# Xcode Cloud manages distribution signing automatically, so no team is needed
# by default; the optional DEVELOPMENT_TEAM env var below is an escape hatch.
#
# Env vars provided by Xcode Cloud:
#   CI_BUILD_NUMBER             monotonically-increasing integer per workflow run
#   CI_PRIMARY_REPOSITORY_PATH  absolute path to the checked-out repo root
#
# Optional env vars (set under Workflow → Environment in App Store Connect;
# mark secret values as such). Unset → the step is skipped, no change in
# behavior:
#   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM            Apple Developer Team ID. When set, written into
#                              Config/Signing.local.xcconfig so the build picks
#                              up the team. Leave unset to let Xcode Cloud
#                              manage signing.
#   FEED_HOST                   Host serving the partner feed. Required: written
#                              into Config/Feed.local.xcconfig; the build fails
#                              without it.
